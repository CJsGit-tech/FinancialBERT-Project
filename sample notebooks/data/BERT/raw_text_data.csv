2018-09-21,"Germany: Rocket tests cause weeks-long moorland fire - CNN : Military rocket tests cause weeks-long moorland fire in northern Germany : Berlin (CNN)Prosecutors are investigating the German armed forces after a fire caused by military rocket tests almost three weeks ago continued to burn across a moorland in northern Germany, a military spokesperson told CNN on Friday. The fire began on September 3 following two rocket tests, the statement said. The area affected is the equivalent of about 1,000 soccer fields, according to the armed forces. The armed forces were also carrying out an internal investigation to determine whether regulations were followed. As the fire continued to spread on Friday morning, the local authority of Emsland declared a catastrophe and urged the 1,100 residents of Stavern, a municipality just north of Meppen, to prepare for possible evacuation. Firefighters work to extinguish the blaze. The armed forces said it was unclear how long it would take before the fire would be fully extinguished. There is currently a ""very high danger"" of weather-related fires in grasslands and forests, according to the German Weather Service. Claudia Otto and Jessica Benne reported from Berlin.",General_Market,articles,190

2016-02-03,"China has been catching up with the West in financial technology. Sadly, not all such progress is good. This week, official news agency Xinhua reported on a Ponzi scheme in China involving $7.6bn — around one-tenth of the funds involved in Bernard Madoff’s scheme, but affecting a million people. @ News of the fraud came at the end of a consultation period on new rules for China’s P2P sector, and highlights the need for more stringent oversight. Unregulated lending has grown quickly as falling benchmark rates enticed yield-hungry savers into riskier products, just as they have elsewhere. Demand has also been strong: private sector small and medium enterprises (SMEs) often struggle to obtain financing from banks, resorting to less formal means of financing. Funding has also tightened following frauds at Agricultural Bank and Citic Bank. @ Online lending failures tend to have a widespread impact. Unlike most developed markets, where institutions use P2P channels to disburse loans to diverse small borrowers, in China it is numerous small creditors that lend to larger debtors. In December last year, nearly 3m people invested $6,800 each into loans averaging $25,800 drawn down by only 780,000 borrowers, according to industry watcher Wangdaizhijia. The threat of unrest from numerous disgruntled savers may now outweigh concerns that regulation will hamper growth.",General_Market,articles,215

The question posed by US China scholar, David Lampton, in a speech in Shanghai in March looks disturbingly prescient after a whirl of diplomatic and security offensives in recent weeks in the region. @ The US and Japan substantially upgraded their defence alliance in a high profile summit meeting in Washington earlier this month. Japan, in turn, held its first naval exercises with Vietnam and the Philippines in the South China Sea. This week, the US announced (and then later denied) it would station B-1 bombers in northern Australia, also with an eye on balancing China in the region. @ Then, just in time for John Kerry’s weekend visit to Beijing, the Pentagon made it known it was contemplating limited military options in the form of naval patrols and surveillance flights in contested areas in the South China Sea to reinforce its opposition to Chinese actions.",Politics_Regulations,articles,163
