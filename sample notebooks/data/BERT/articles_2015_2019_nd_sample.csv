": WASHINGTON -- From tax cuts to relaxed regulations to tariffs, each of President Trump's economic initiatives is based on a promise: to set off a wave of investment and bring back jobs that the president says the United States has lost to foreign countries. "" We have the greatest companies anywhere in the world,"" Mr. Trump said at the White House recently. "" They're coming back to the United States."" Investment growth turned negative this spring, providing a drag on economic output. In Mr. Trump's first two years in office, companies announced plans to relocate just under 145,000 factory jobs to the United States, according to data and modeling by the Reshoring Initiative, a nonprofit group. And administration officials assert that tariffs are helping to create jobs. But he said, ""You're also going to have factories moving back in from other places around the world, including China."" Pharmaceutical imports from those countries actually rose in 2018, he noted. Morgan Stanley's Business Conditions Index shows that companies' plans for new investment plummeted this summer. That flow of money ""doesn't mean all that much,"" Mr. Setser said. "" You're not in any way seeing a shift in real activity back to the United States."" We're sensing and seeing a betrayal of workers and promises broken over and over again,"" said Mr. Brown, a Democrat.

": How low must unemployment go for workers to get a raise? Wages improved up and down the scale as the economy hit full employment. Target and even Walmart have granted their workers raises. This suggests a double challenge for the nation's workers. For workers to reap a larger share of the spoils of growth, they must claw back the bargaining power they lost. Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggests that to begin with, policymakers could do more to keep labor markets tight. That compares with only a third of the time from 1949 to 1980. For starters, they eventually end when the cycle turns -- and wages can get stuck for a long time. And tight labor markets don't carry the power they used to. Or how about restoring competition to labor markets?

"There is a consensus that the US should substantially raise its level of infrastructure investment.

As it becomes clearer that growth will not return to pre-financial-crisis levels on its own, the urgency of policy action rises.

"When Apple, the world’s most valuable company, revealed this month that it would no longer disclose how many iPhones or Macs it sells, talk of “peak iPhone” swirled around the market. @ Although a seemingly minor reporting adjustment, the change reflects a broader concern that demand for smartphones is falling, sending shockwaves through the global semiconductor sector and other parts of the iPhone supply chain. @ That, combined with other problems from falling cryptocurrency values to global trade wars, has prompted questions over whether the once high-flying semiconductor industry is facing a long-term, structural slump.",negative
"Theresa May: After latest Brexit defeat what's next for the Prime Minister ? - CNN : What's next for Theresa May after yet another Brexit failure? : The defeat is a setback for May's attempts to get her plans approved by Parliament and a blow to her authority over her party and the Commons. But it also risks further undermining her credibility with EU leaders. JUST WATCHEDBrexit: What is the Irish backstop?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBrexit: What is the Irish backstop? 02:06Read MoreThe Prime Minister will hold further talks with EU leaders next week. Yet as of Friday, there are now 42 days until Britain is supposed to leave the EU on March 29, with or without a deal. Only an extension to the deadline, which must be approved by the EU, can delay that cliff-edge moment. That window is even smaller than 42 days because the Commons does not sit at weekends and most Fridays.

Both options will be ringing alarm bells in Downing Street today. It is not clear whether she can survive many more.",negative

"The state is the most important of all our institutional innovations. It is the ultimate guarantor of security. For this reason, people sometimes pretend it is weaker than it is. In one area of economics, this is particularly true: money. Modern monetary theory, a controversial account of this truth, is analytically correct, so far as it goes. L Randall Wray of the University of Missouri-Kansas City set out these ideas in Modern Monetary Theory. They have the following fundamental elements. @ They are imperfect, because banks may become illiquid or insolvent and so may default. Since the financial crisis, central bank balance sheets and bank reserves have grown hugely, but broader monetary aggregates have not. The weakness of credit also explains why inflation has remained low. @ Finally, governments do not need to issue bonds in order to fund themselves. But such ideas do not follow from their analysis. These are just suggestions for where the state should spend. @ These are twofold: economic and political. Excess demand may exist in some sectors or regions, and deficient demand elsewhere. Full employment is a highly uncertain range, not a single point. @ This may not lead to outright hyperinflation. That happened to many western countries in the 1970s. Yet the same is also true for high unemployment. The opposite error is to rely on government-led demand too much, since that may well generate destructive inflation booms and busts. @ There is then no reason to fear the constraints.",negative

": EARNINGS Deere Outlook for 2019 Disappoints Deere & Co gave an underwhelming earnings forecast on Wednesday for fiscal 2019 after missing quarterly profit estimates amid a United States trade battle with China that has depressed U.S. farm commodity prices and hurt agriculture equipment demand. That would translate into earnings of $11.10 per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $11.47, according to Refinitiv data. Equipment sales for the world's largest tractor manufacturer are estimated to grow 7 percent on the year in 2019 compared with a 29 percent jump in fiscal 2018, which ended Oct. 28. Still, the company's shares opened higher as investors cheered the projected improvements in gross margins as well as the forecast for a flat to 5 percent increase in industry sales of agricultural equipment next year in North America, its biggest market. The October drop led by a huge decline in the volatile areas of commercial and military aircraft. A.P. HOUSING Mortgage Rates Decline, But Remain High U.S. long-term mortgage rates recorded the biggest drop in nearly four years this week, but remain much higher than they were a year ago. It was the biggest weekly drop since January 2015. But the 30-year rate was still up from 3.92 percent a year ago. But Freddie Mac chief economist Sam Khater says rates were pushed lower this week by tumbling oil prices and stock prices. A.P.

"The Belgian government issued a private diplomatic protest to France this week over what it perceives as the French leadership’s unfair blaming of Belgium for Friday’s terrorist attacks in Paris, saying that homegrown jihadism is as much a problem for France as it is for Belgium. @ The protest, made by Prime Minister Charles Michel’s chief diplomatic adviser to the French ambassador to Belgium on Tuesday, comes after international scrutiny has focused on the Brussels neighbourhood of Molenbeek, home to at least three of the attackers and the militant believed to be the plot’s architect. @ Belgian officials said only one of the three teams that carried out the Paris attack was linked to Molenbeek, and that France was attempting to point the finger at Belgian failings to cover up its own domestic lapses in countering Islamic extremism.",negative
